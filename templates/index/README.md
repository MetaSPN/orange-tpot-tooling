# Creator index

This repo aggregates metadata for creator repos. Use it to track updates and build composable follow lists.

- **creators/manifest.json** — List of creator repos with displayName, blogUrl, followUrl, lastUpdated, postCount. Regenerated by the update workflow.
- **creators/repos.json** — Config: list of creator repo URLs (or paths) to include. Edit this to add/remove creators; the workflow reads it to refresh the manifest.
- **subrepos/** — Optional: add creator repos as git submodules for full clone and QMD indexing.

## Update workflow

The GitHub Action runs on a schedule and on manual trigger. It:

1. If using submodules: runs `git submodule update --remote` (or equivalent).
2. For each repo in `creators/repos.json`, fetches `creator.json` (and optionally metadata) and aggregates into `creators/manifest.json`.
3. Commits and pushes if the manifest changed.

## Composable follow lists

You can filter `manifest.json` by adding a `tags` or `lists` array per creator (e.g. in repos.json or in each creator's creator.json) so other tools can build "follow list X" from the manifest.
